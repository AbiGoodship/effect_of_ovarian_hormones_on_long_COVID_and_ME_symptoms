# Digital health app data reveals an effect of ovarian hormones on long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis symptoms

**Background**
Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) disproportionally affect females, suggesting modulation by sex hormones. We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or from hormonal contraception. 

**Methods**
We conducted a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data collected prospectively from individuals with long COVID/ME/CFS and regular length menstrual cycles through the Visible app from 7th September 2022 to 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

**Findings**
948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99·5% of included users), brain fog (88·3%), headaches (85·1%) and muscle aches (78·6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly in the early luteal phase (IRR = 0·963, 95% CI: 0·958–0·968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0·985, 95% CI: 0·981–0·990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0·980, 95% CI: 0·974–0·985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during the menstrual phase than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0·827, 95% CI: 0·690–0·992) and crash incidence (OR = 0·548, 95% CI: 0·350–0·856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786). 

**Interpretation**
Menstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their day-to-day activities accordingly. The findings could also inform their choice of contraception.
